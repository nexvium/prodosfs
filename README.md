# prodosfs
A mountable read-only filesystem for Apple II ProDOS 8 disk images.

# Description

prodosfs is a FUSE filesystem that allows mounting images of Apple II ProDOS 8 disks in Linux for read-only access. Once mounted, the ProDOS files and directories can be viewed with standard GNU/Linux tools (ls, cat, etc).

## Limitations

This sofware was written to allow to recovery of the author's 30+-year-old files. As such, it is by no means intended to be a full, polished implementation of a ProDOS filesystem. Only functionality required to read one or more of the author's 5.25" floppy disk images is implemented.

Since it is intended mainly for personal use on small disks, there has been little effort spent on optimization or performance.
